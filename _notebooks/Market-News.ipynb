       "- Cardano, Solana, Avalanche, and Polkadot Compete For Ethereum’s DeFi Supremacy.  Ethereum is currently in the driver’s seat when it comes to the region of DeFi, NFTs and smart contracts; however, as the network’s transaction (gas) fees continue to rise and the adoption of smart contracts continues to grow on other blockchain networks, it is possible that there will not be a single market king for smart contracts. Instead, multiple cryptocurrencies may look to stay on top. Others looking to take a larger market share in DeFi Ethereum was the first cryptocurrency to feature smart contracts, and its network already hosts numerous projects. Due to this extensive use of smart contracts, Ethereum experienced remarkable popularity in the cryptocurrency world last year. Although this is a positive development for the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world, congestion issues and high transaction fees persist. Ethereum’s developers have already devised a solution to the network congestion and scalability problem, which is Ethereum 2.0. However, until Ethereum completes this upgrade, several alternative smart contract cryptocurrencies will continue to compete for market dominance. Ethereum is one of the primary participants in DeFi and presently leads the NFT industry, but this is poised to change in the face of severe competition from prominent competing blockchains supporting smart contracts, such as Avalanche (AVAX), Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), and Polkadot (DOT). All of these competing blockchains operate di... ...

       "- Top Reasons to be a Tron (TRX) Long-term Investor.  Tron (TRX)has been around since 2017. TRX was one of the top six cryptocurrencies in early 2018 and the young Tron founder, Justin Sun stated that one of his missions in 2018 was to displace Ethereum. The target has not yet been achieved though Tron blockchain has made a lot of success since then. Tron has a present price of $0.07432 which is 58.73% higher than its present 52-week price of $0.04682. TRX is presently in the 14th position in the CoinMarketCap ranking of cryptocurrencies. Irrespective of this position, the Tron network token (TRX) might be an undervalued cryptocurrency for the following reasons: Tron token (TRX) performance with respect to some top cryptocurrencies In the past 30 days, the price of Tron (TRX) has increased by 18.08%. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and BNB within the same duration had reduced in price by 27%, 34.52%, and 27.02% respectively. This means that an investor who owns an equal amount of the four coins in United States dollars has increased by over 4.86 times when compared to investments in the other three cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, and BNB) put together.
