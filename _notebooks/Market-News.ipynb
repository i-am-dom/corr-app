       "- Bitcoin Recovery Wades Off Celsius Liquidation, But For How Long?.  The price of bitcoin has made a remarkable recovery above $20,000 after a brutal week riddled with crashes. These dips had driven decentralized finance (DeF)/ lending protocol Celsius, to the brink of liquidation. However, as the price has recovered, the platform is once again able to hold out for longer as its liquidation point is now a bit further away. The question remains if the recovery will hold and if Celsius will be able to avoid liquidation. Liquidation Price Pushed Back With the price of bitcoin above $20,000, the liquidation price of Celsius is now a little bit distant. This has not changed the sentiment around the lending protocol though, which has now suspended withdrawals for 7 days at this point. Its liquidation price still remains firmly at $14,000 but the company has assured the community that it continues to work to rectify the issues. Celsius had first announced the transfer and withdrawal freeze last Monday citing unstable market conditions as the reason behind the move. Even with the recent recovery, the lending protocol remains at risk of liquidation, and as such withdrawals and transfers remain frozen. Related Reading &#124; Bitcoin Funding Rates Remain Negative But Open Interest Tells Another Story In its most recent communique with the public, Celsius has said that it is working with officials to find a suitable resolution to its issues. “As has been a priority since our company’s inception, we maintai... ...

       "- TA: Bitcoin Consolidates Near Key Juncture, Can The Bulls Make It.  Bitcoin is struggling near the $21,000 resistance zone against the US Dollar. BTC could rally if it clears the $20,900 and $21,000 resistance levels. Bitcoin is showing a few positive signs above the $20,000 support. The price is now still above the $20,000 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support near $20,275 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh decline if it stays below the key $21,000 resistance zone. Bitcoin Price Eyes Upside Break Bitcoin price started an upside correction after it traded as low as $17,600. There was a decent recovery wave above the $18,500 and $19,000 levels. The price surpassed the 50% Fib retracement level of the main drop from the $22,951 high to $17,600 low. The price even cleared the $20,000 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average. There is also a connecting bullish trend line forming with support near $20,275 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. However, the bears are now defending major gains above the $20,500 zone. Bitcoin is also struggling near the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the main drop from the $22,951 high to $17,600 low. An immediate resistance on the upside is near the $20,800 level. The first major resistance is near the $20,900 and $21,000 levels. Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com A clear move above the $21,000 level could even push the price towar... ...
