       "- As Ethereum Price Suffers, Investors Wonder If ETH Can Become Deflationary.  Ethereum has not been left out of the onslaught currently happening in the market. The coin has lost over 2.4% in the last 24 hours and is now trading in the $1,700 territory as of the time of writing this article. The digital asset continues to dip as the crypto market continues to experience massive losses. Ethereum has now lost over 50% from its all-time high in April when the coin had shot past $4,000. Holders continue to remain bullish on the coin as upgrades promise new and exciting things in the future of the digital asset. The coin continues to experience growing anticipation in wait for the move to ETH 2.0. Related Reading &#124;&#160;Ethereum 2.0 Contract Reaches 100,000 ETH Milestone But now a whole other question has arisen in regards to Ethereum, and that is if the digital asset will ever become deflationary. Unlimited ETH Supply Given the structure of Ethereum, it is not a stretch to say that the digital asset does not possess any hard cap. The network is structured that for every new block created, two ETH coins are produced. Then this means that as long as people continue to use the network, then more ETH coins will continue to be created. An unlimited supply of any currency or asset puts that asset or currency at risk for inflation. Thus, Ethereum&#8217;s model remains an inflationary one due to there being no cap on the overall supply of ETH. Related Reading &#124;&#160;Ethereum Whales Go On Buying Spree, Top... ...

       "- After 3 Months In The Red, Why Bitcoin Is The Crypto Market’s Best Performer.  Bitcoin broke below its support zones and trades around its yearly open after another massive selloff. At the time of writing, the first cryptocurrency by market cap trades at $29,605 with an 11.2% loss in the weekly chart. The crypto market has followed Bitcoin, except for a handful of coins, and the top ten sit on more pronounced losses. For three consecutive months, BTC and major cryptocurrencies have been in the red. May and June saw two capitulation events that pushed BTC&#8217;s price below its current levels. Hence why so many investors and traders expect further downside to consolidating a third and possibly final capitulation. The weeks leading to the most recent crash saw Ethereum (ETH) outperforming Bitcoin (BTC). The second cryptocurrency by market cap rose from around $1,600 to $2,390 before retracing to current levels. However, a recent report by Arcane Research concluded that BTC remains the best performer in the crypto market. In consequence, the BTC Dominance has increased as altcoins are pushed further down their support levels. As seen below, the Bitcoin Dominance stood at 46.92% by the time the report was published with ETH following with a 16.96%. USDT (5.12%), BNB (3.72%), ADA (2.86%) taking on XRP (2.05%) and DOGE (1.82%) positions. The chart shows that Bitcoin retraces around 11.2% since the beginning of July 2021. Cryptocurrencies with large market caps saw the less severe drops with only 18.5% closely... ... [| Skaityti daugiau](https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/why-bitcoin-markets-best-performer/) "
