However, during the previous month, the BTC miners have increased their outflow. A new set of tax policies targeted at preventing domestic cryptocurrency mining were unveiled by Kazakhstan, which is still a significant nation in the world of Bitcoin mining. During a halt in worldwide activity and fire sales connected to recent bankruptcy-related news, prices for Bitcoin mining rigs are also said to have fallen to epidemic lows for 2020. Most significantly, Texas power grid operators have asked all Bitcoin miners to cease operations in order to lessen the strain on a power grid that is already overloaded. Bitcoin Miners Inflow Reach New ATH IT Tech reports that Bitcoin miners transferred over 14,000 BTC to an exchange in a single block. The transfer from the miner wallet to the exchange was noted as being unfavorable for the market. According to their definition of mining pool wallets in their stats, all pool members—including the specific miner—are included. One user did point out that those Bitcoin were not reflected in the spot market or derivatives, though. Glassnode reported that the BTC Miners&#8217; Netflow Volume on a 7-day moving average (MA) basis hit an all-time high (ATH) of $1,779,953. In the first week of January 2022, an ATH of $1,700,940 was registered. This outflow did not stop on the exchange wallet, according to Ki Young Ju... ...
