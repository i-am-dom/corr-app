       "- Bitcoin Exchange Traded Products Near 1% Of Total BTC Supply.  Bitcoin exchange traded products (ETPs) have had a good month in March. BTC assets under management had grown exponentially in this one-month period to touch a new all-time high. This is propelled forward by the inflows that have categorized these ETPs in the last month. This has made March one of the most successful months for bitcoin ETPs as all BTC products have marked positive net flows over this time period. Bitcoin AUM At New All-Time High The total bitcoin AUM had gone up dramatically in March. Looking at the numbers show this movement to be one of the highest growth trends ever recorded in this regard. The previous one was the jump that was recorded back in November of 2021. By February, the total asset under management had been sitting at 190,165 BTC. However, by the end of March, this number had grown as high as 202,437 BTC. This constituted a new record for BTC under management. Related Reading &#124; Bitcoin Retail Reaches Second-Highest Buying Rate In History. Good Or Bad? The net inflows for March were a big addition to this. In total, there were 12,727 BTC that flowed into ETPs last month alone. This had helped the digital asset mark its strongest month in terms of ETP inflows since November. Inflows were recorded all across the board and across all regions. BTC ETPs hit a record high in March &#124; Source: Arcane Research An example of this was the Canadian ETFs which recorded one of the sharpest growth in its... ...
