       "- TA: Bitcoin Faces Another Rejection, Can Bulls Save The Day.  Bitcoin spiked above the $20,500 resistance against the US Dollar. BTC is now struggling near $19,800, with a major support near the $19,600 zone. Bitcoin made another attempt to gain strength above $20,500 but failed. The price is now trading above the $19,500 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support near $19,550 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could rise again unless there is a clear move below the $19,500 support zone. Bitcoin Price Faces Hurdles Bitcoin price remained supported above the $19,500 zone. BTC started another increase and climbed above the $20,000 resistance zone. There was a spike above the $20,500 resistance zone but the bulls failed to gain strength. A high was formed near $20,732 and the price corrected gains. There was a drop below the $20,200 and $20,000 support levels. Bitcoin traded below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $19,300 swing low to $20,732 swing high. It is now trading above the $19,500 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support near $19,550 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $20,000 and $20,200 levels. The next key resistance is near the $20,500 zone. A close above the $20,500 resistance zone could open the doors for a decent increase. Source... ... [| Skaityti daugiau](https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-faces-another-rejection-20k/) "
