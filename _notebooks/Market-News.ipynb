       "- Tron (TRX) Extends Gains As Prices Break Away From Support Point.  While the rest of the crypto market is in a state of frenzy, Tron (TRX) price dominance is on for the second day in a row as its price swerves away from the support line. Tron has had a swift recovery so far. TRX/USD swished to a 3% jump and intraday high of $0.06631 today in contrast to yesterdayâ€™s low that registered at $0.06383. The rebound was seen after TRX has been moving in the red zone for several days now. The cross signals seen in the daily chart usually hint a downtrend but it somehow triggered a bull run. Related Reading &#124; Tezos (XTZ) Price Movement Indicates Looming Price Drop TRON RSI To Cross 49.85 Resistance Line This will be tested soon as the RSI is seen to cross the 49.85 resistance level. The current price of the TRX/USD pair is at $0.064 and has declined by 2.15% in the past 24 hours. In addition, trading volumes have reduced by 1.89 as seen overnight. TRX bears are seen to ascend in the coming days. A few days ago, technical indicators all show a bearish perspective for Tron which has to retrieve the resistance level at $0.07 to gain back the confidence of investors and step on the gas for a bull run. But, it seems the odds arenâ€™t in favor of a bullish standpoint considering that the bears have already been collared in the market. Once the support level is hauled back to $0.06, then itâ€™s the break the bulls needed to reclaim the market. Crypto total market cap at $1.02 trillion on the daily chart &#1... ...
