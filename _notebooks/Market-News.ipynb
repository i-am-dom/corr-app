The protocol&#8217;s ease of use and lower fees have been major draws for developers, leading to a wide variety of new projects coming to life on the platform. Meanwhile, the folks over at Amun Tokens are working on DeFi index tokens left and right. In June, the platform announced the launch of two index tokens, $DFI and $DMX, engaged in the Ethereum ecosystem. Given Polygon&#8217;s increased presence lately in DeFi, it was only a matter of time before the team at Amun unleashed a Polygon-based token as well. That time has come, as Amun announced today their latest token headed to pre-sale: PECO. This token looks to encapsulate the best and brightest projects being built on Polygon. Amun, PECO, &#38; The Polygon Ecosystem Amun released their Medium post announcing PECO today in collaboration with the Polygon Foundation and leading Polygon projects. The Foundation is providing $5M in MATIC tokens to seed the index&#8217;s launch, according to the Medium post, and many leading projects are providing seed capital for liquidity. The token initially launches on October 19 and will start with 50% MATIC until the network matures further. Protocol tokens make up the remaining 50%; take a look at the initial PECO compensation on launch below: &#160; As the Polygon network grows and develops, the PECO portfolio will be rebalanced monthly.
