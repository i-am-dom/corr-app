The TRX/BTC pair registers an increase of 0.28% at 0.000002895 BTC. The token is now sweeping through an uptrend wave as seen in the daily price chart. There is an obvious power struggle between the bulls and the bears which impacted the price but it seems neither was able to pull off a riveting dominance in the market. It helped that Bitcoin (BTC) did some heavy lifting as its price briefly soared above the 24K price zone which also propelled the entire market up. Tron Still Grappling With Losses TRX price surged by over 15% in just five days but it’s still grappling with losses in the part of the investors.

       "- DOT Clamping On $8 Support Crucial To Maintain Bullish Pace.  Can Polkadot (DOT) hold on to dear life as its price nosedived by 4% on the daily charts right after it peaked at $8.84? The $8 support line is seen as a critical zone for the coin, especially with the prevailing seller pressure going on. DOT is seen to go downhill or can plunge to $6 in the coming days. On the brighter side, the token&#8217;s price is generally bullish as shown in the extended increase which propelled its price to a high of $8.84 seen yesterday. On the other hand, DOT is seen to have decreased by 4% in price overnight. On July 26, 2022, its price formed an extended ascending triangle pattern when the price plunged to a mere $6.55.Cryp DOT Breaks Resistance At $8.5 Hereinafter, DOT has been extremely bullish and breaking the resistance seen at $8.5 and as it trades above $8.60. Support clamped at $8 is mission-critical for Polkadot price, especially with imminent selling pressure. With that in mind, any movement that swerves below this critical line could trigger a worse downtrend that may result in a price decline to $6.15. Major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum also suffered a massive drop in the past 24 hours. Bitcoin evidently dipped by 3% or towards $23,700, while Ethereum plunged dramatically to $1,700. With the altcoins, Ripple spiked by 3% reaching $0.38, Cardano dropped to $0.52, Solana soared to $44.22, while Dogecoin plunged by 3% and fell to $0.07.
