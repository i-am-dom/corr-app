       "- Cardano Developer Reveals Progress On Scaling Protocol Hydra.  Cardano announced its Hydra protocol last year and has continued to develop on it ever since. The project which finally gained smart contract capability in 2021 has been making strides in proving that it is a force to be reckoned with in the space. Its decentralized finance (DeFi) space has begun to take off. Now, it offers insight into the Hydra protocol and how much progress the team has made with scaling it. Hydra Has Evolved In a recently published report on its official website, the developer behind Cardano known as IOG has provided more information on what the project Hydra is up to. It explains where the protocol is now if far from where it is coming from. Hydra which was created by the Ouborous team to increase throughput, minimize latency, and provide cost-efficient solutions without sacrificing storage resources continues to evolve. Related Reading &#124; Bitcoin On-Chain Demands Suggests That The Market Has Reached Its Bottom Hydra has now matured into a proof of concept protocol, something that was not in the initial roadmap. This has pushed the project towards “a more defined implementation for the testate MVP.” There are different Hydra Heads, which involve a robust network layer between Cardano and other blockchains, as well as other smart contracts that will drive the lifecycle of a Hydra Head. Acting as a mini-ledger, it works similarly to the on-chain main ledger of the Cardano network, but on a smaller scale... ...
