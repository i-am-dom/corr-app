       "- TRON Showing Hints Of A Major Rebound After A Week Of Rout.  Tron (TRX) holders have been on rough terrain since August with the bears dominating the market. The tables might be turning though in favor of the bulls as shown on the charts. TRX bulls hint at a comeback after a long period of takeover by the bears TRX price down by 0.87% RSI divergence hints at increased investor optimism According to CoinMarketCap, TRX&#8217;s price has plunged by 0.87% or trading at $0.0596 as of this writing. Apparently, Tron is trying to bounce back from its weekly low that registered at $0.056. It seems that the token is still traversing in the same range which validates a strong rebound from that level.
