       "- Advantages of Decentralized Finance Protocols Creating More Applications.  Today, cryptocurrencies have developed into a trillion-dollar ecosystem that is making a lot of impacts on the global financial system. Cryptocurrencies have a long history of innovation, dating back to the 1980s with the introduction of encryption. Since then, several events have occurred that have changed the crypto world, with Bitcoin and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) being the most significant. Even though Bitcoin has expanded significantly over the last 12 years, financial services have been reluctant to evolve. This is primarily due to Bitcoin’s insecurity and the fact that few people use it. In addition, because Bitcoin’s price fluctuates so dramatically, most financial institutions don’t consider investing in it. As a result, Bitcoin has become a poor asset to invest in. Decentralized finance (DeFi) is a current trend in the cryptocurrency ecosystem that is making a lot of impacts these days. If you don’t know much about DeFi, let’s dive into it and learn more about it. What is DeFi? DeFi is an acronym that stands for “decentralized finance.” It is a term for a diverse set of public blockchain apps and projects that aspire to transform the way traditional finance operates. DeFi refers to financial applications that use smart contracts built on blockchain technology. Smart contracts can carry out agreements automatically and without the involvement of a middleman. Anyone with an internet connection can access them. DeFi ... ...

       "- Why Should We Put All Trust in Web3? Could It Be a Dead End?.  At first, everyone was content communicating with one another via the Internet. Everyone was happy whenever bits were sent correctly. Then, after decades of sending bits in increasingly larger chunks, some people began to wonder if we could do better. Maybe there’s something we can do to make things a little better? Some believe that the term Web3 is the answer. But unfortunately, there is no official committee, and everyone has their interpretation of what these four letters mean. Still, the goal is the same: to find a way to bring the certainty and security of cryptocurrencies to the rest of the internet. Why Should We Trust Web3? There are different reasons why we should put our trust in Web3. The reasons are as follows: Decentralized control helps everyone One of the original goals of the Internet was to create a network that was not controlled by a single entity. Web3 supports this notion and believes that no single person or group should be in charge of transactions. This decentralized and shared control concept can be applied to all aspects of the market and daily life. Of course, some may think it’s silly to be concerned about power and control over some of the least important parts of the Internet. Still, a quick look at history reveals that the world has many reasons to be concerned about centralized power. Web3 wishes to protect us from all of them. Web3 will use better protocols Even though Bitcoin consumes a lot o... ...
