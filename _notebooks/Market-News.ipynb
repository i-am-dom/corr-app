       "- TRX Technical Analysis: Justin Sun Brings BOOM to TRX Prices.  TRX coin price shows an outstanding bullish growth overnight to surpass all the crucial EMAs within hours. But will the uptrend survive above $0.070? Key technical points: TRX prices surpass the $275 mark. The 50 and 200-day EMA give a golden crossover. The 24-hour trading volume of Tron is $424.93 Million, marking a 93% rise. Past Performance of TRX TRX coin price shows a remarkable reversal with the news of Justin Sun launching an algorithmic stablecoin USDD on Tron Ecosystem and using $10 Bn crypto as collateral. The reversal rally reaches the 200-day EMA at the $0.071 resistance zone from the depth of the $0.060 mark. Source-Tradingview TRX Technical Analysis TRX coin price shows a high bullish commitment as the trading volume grows phenomenally to accompany the price surge. Hence, the uptrend may shortly reach the $0.077 mark if it sustains above the resistance zone. Today’s sudden price jump knocked out the 20-50-and-100 EMA slope in one strike. However, the 200-day EMA aligned with the $0.0714 resistance puts significant selling pressure on traders. RSI Indicator: The RSI slope(63) skyrocketed into the bullish territory, indicating the aggressive buying in the market. However, the indicator reflects a bearish divergence concerning the 31st March peak, projecting some weakness in this bullish momentum. MACD Indicator: The MACD and signal lines bullish crossover offers a buy signal for the interested traders. Moreover, th... ...

       "- The Art of Swing Trading on the Binance Futures Market.  Binance’s futures market has grown substantially in the past few months and it’s now second only to BitMEX in terms of volume traded. However, unlike BitMEX which offers perpetual contracts, Binance’s futures have expiry dates which traders must consider when trading on this platform. With careful consideration of supply and demand fundamentals and the use of stop-losses, swing trading futures on Binance can be very profitable. In fact, you can use futures to leverage your existing crypto holdings without actually buying more crypto! Let me show you how it works… Diversify Your Portfolio While many swing traders focus on finding and selling undervalued assets, others look for overvalued ones and buy them at a lower price. This strategy requires technical and fundamental analysis to determine which assets to trade. While this strategy can be profitable, it is not for everyone. Using multiple asset classes and sectors is essential. Diversifying your portfolio is important if you want to achieve consistent, long-term trading success. It helps protect your capital, manage your risk, enables you to withstand market volatility, and realize gains from only a few positions. Although, it is very tempting to buy a single asset and hold it for a long period. Instead, you should diversify your portfolio to avoid losing a significant amount of money. Before you start swing trading on the Binance Futures Market, make sure you understand inv... ...
