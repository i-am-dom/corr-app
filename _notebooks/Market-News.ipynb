       "- Here’s What’s In Store For Cardano In 2022.  Cardano has no doubt had an interesting year in 2021. Its native token, ADA, had grown from less than 30 cents to its record high above $3. It was a remarkable year filled with firsts for the project, the most notable being the launch of smart contract capability on the network. As the year 2021 draws to a close, investors are beginning to look towards the new year and what might be in stock for these digital assets. To this end, founder Charles Hoskinson once again took to his YouTube channel, where he explained to 300,000 subscribers in a live video, what they should expect in the coming year. Related Reading &#124; By The Numbers: How Ethereum 2.0 One-Year Stats Stack Up DeFi On Cardano The deployment of decentralized finance (DeFi) on the Cardano blockchain has been a long-awaited event for both the network and its supporters. With smart contracts capability launched in September, expectations have grown even more as investors anticipate the launch of the first DeFi protocols. Developers continue to work hard towards this goal. Hoskison took time to address this important part of the Cardano network as he explained his plan to bring affordable loans to the network through DeFi. He outlines this goal as something he is working towards so that by the second half of 2022, there can be working protocols on the network where people are able to perform end-to-end Microfinance transactions on the blockchain. “My goal for the seco... ...
