       "- Bitcoin Price Grinds Lower, Why The Bears Are Not Done Yet.  Bitcoin price is slowly moving lower towards $15,500. BTC remains at a risk of more losses unless it settles above the $17,000 resistance zone. Bitcoin started a fresh decline below the $16,500 and $16,400 levels. The price is trading below $16,500 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $16,390 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could start a decent increase if there is a move above the $16,500 resistance zone. Bitcoin Price Restarts Decline Bitcoin price failed to gain pace above the $17,000 resistance. BTC struggled to stay above the $16,650 level and started a fresh decline. The recent swing high was formed near $16,795 before the price dropped below the $16,500 support. There was a close below the $16,500 zone and the 100 hourly simple moving average. The bears even pushed the price towards the $16,150 level. A low is formed near $16,156 and the price is now consolidating losses. On the upside, an immediate resistance is near the $16,300 level. It is near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $16,795 swing high to $16,156 low. The first major resistance is near the $16,400 zone. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $16,390 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The next major resistance is near the $16,500 level. It is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $16,795 swing high to $16,156 low. Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com Bitcoin price must clear the trend line resistance and then the 100 hourly simple moving average to move into a positive zone. The next major resistance is near $17,000, above which the price could gain pace for a move towards the $18,000 zone. More Losses in BTC? If bitcoin fails to gain pace above the $16,400 resistance zone, it could continue to move down. An immediate support on the downside is near the $16,150 level. The next major support is near the $16,000 zone, below which the price might test the key support at $15,500. A clear move below the $15,500 support might send the price further lower. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now in the oversold zone. Major Support Levels – $16,150, followed by $16,000. Major Resistance Levels – $16,350, $16,400 and $16,500. ...

Bitcoin (BTC-USD) fell by 1.3% in the last seven days, and the second biggest crypto Ethereum (ETH-USD), is now down by 6.4%. This comes even though it's been two weeks since the FTX disaster, the collapse of the Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) crypto empire, which is still affecting the markets. The crypto market, however, received a boost of hope last Tuesday, November 15, after fresh data from the U.S. Labor Department's latest PPI (Producer Price Index) report, which came in at 0.2% month-over-month against expectations of 0.4%.
