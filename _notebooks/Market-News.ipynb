       "- This Expert Claims Crypto Winter Is Not Over But There’s A Catch.  The ongoing crypto bear market seems like an unending journey, with more firms coming down with financial crises due to asset devaluations and other effects. Although some assets have seen brief rallies, many remain in decline. Regarding the crypto bear effects, Kathleen Breitman, CEO of Tezos, a blockchain platform, shared her opinion. Breitman thinks the end of the crypto winter is not near yet, but she is confident about the survival of a few useful crypto applications. Related Reading: Bitcoin Shocker: Lightning Network Capacity Reaches 5,000 BTC Reasons For Price Devaluations The Tezos CEO argued that the recent rallies do not signify the end of the bear market. In her opinion, easy money from venture capitalists seeking profit and low-interest rates artificially hiked the valuations of many crypto companies. Kathleen further said that even if the Feds stop hiking interest rates, only a few useful crypto applications that can grow organic users will survive. The CEO also commented on the fall in the price of many digital assets in 2022. She said easy money going into the system inflated the values of digital assets. She cited examples of crypto devaluation in the industry using the OpenSea NFT marketplace as a case study. According to data from Dune Analytics, OpenSea’s trading volume dropped from ~$3 billion in September 2021 to less than $350 million in September 2022. Kathleen explained that the cheap money phenomenon ... ... [| Skaityti daugiau](https://www.newsbtc.com/crypto/this-expert-claims-crypto-winter-is-not-over-but-theres-a-catch/) "

       "- Why Cardano (ADA) Could Be Gearing Up For A Rally.  Cardano (ADA) price has struggled tremendously since it hit its all-time high price of $3.10 back in 2021. Even now, with the crypto market recovery, ADA has not made as many gains as others in the market as indicators point largely toward bearishness for the digital asset. However, a new development could see a recovery in the price ofCa Cardano. FTX Plans To List ADA FTX remains the only one of the largest crypto exchanges that are yet to list Cardano. Obviously, this has not gone over well with members of the community who have continued to inquire why the exchange was yet to list the digital asset for trading. One of such inquiry was recently targeted at FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) who gave an explanation as to why this was the case. The tweet asked why the exchange was listing lesser-known tokens for trading and yet continued to pass up ADA, which is currently a top 10 cryptocurrency by market cap. Related Reading: Crypto World Meets Boris Johnson: A Match Made In Heaven Or Hell? SBF’s response to this was that the crypto exchange was actually working on adding Cardano for trading. However, he referred to the blockchain as being “new”, so they were still working on integrating it into the platform in the near future. working on ADA! It&#39;s a new blockchain which takes some time to implement but we&#39;ll be there soon &#8212; SBF (@SBF_FTX) November 2, 2022 The FTX CEO further clarified that he did not mean that the... ...
