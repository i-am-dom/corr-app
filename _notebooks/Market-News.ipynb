Over the last week, the price action of the altcoin wasn&#8217;t positive as it lost most of the gains in the week. Continued buyer recovery could push ADA past its next resistance level.

       "- Ripple Outperforming Almost The Whole Market, What’s Pumping XRP Price?.  The currency of the blockchain-powered online payment platform, XRP, has gained almost 60% in the past week. After briefly dipping to $0.34 five days ago, the token climbed back and traded around $0.52 this morning. Crypto influencer Ben Armstrong claims to know the reason behind this continuous climb amid the current general crypto bear market. The multiple-crypto holder shared his two cents about the state of events with his 800k plus followers on Twitter yesterday. Related Reading: Maker DAO Shows Bullish Sentiment After A While, Eyes $800? Influencer Believes Impending Close To Ripple-SEC Case Is Responsible According to Armstrong, multiple factors are causing Ripple’s insane price surge. However, he can confidently trace one primary reason to the ongoing SEC court battle with the sixth strongest crypto. The influencer tweeted that SEC has given up on its 2-year struggle of trying to prove XRP is a security. As of this week, the Ripple community “can be pretty confident the worst-case scenario is a fine,” the tweet reads. The last weekend saw both parties in the ongoing case filing for summary judgment. In other words, Ripple and SEC believe enough evidence has been provided for a verdict outside a court case. They wait for Judge Torres’ decision supporting one side or the other based on already available evidence. A court battle that started way over in 2020 might soon be coming to an end.
