       "- Cardano Records Over 20 Million Transactions Ahead of DEX Launches.  The Cardano network remains one of the most stable blockchains in the crypto space. Founded in 2017, the network remains the largest proof of stake network in the industry. It holds the title for the proof of stake network with the highest amount of coins staked, only recently conceding to Solana to become the smart contracts platform with the second-largest amount of coins staked. Nevertheless, Cardano remains a force to be reckoned with and its latest achievement has shown that. Network activity has picked up on the network since the launch of smart contracts capability. Now, a little over two months after, the network has marked its 20 millionth transaction after only four years in operation.

Most projects in the market have experienced downtime at some point. Most notably the Solana network blackout that saw the network go dark for about 24 hours. Cardano itself has experienced downtime which occurred in April but it lasted for only an hour and was over so quickly that a good portion of the community does not know this happened. Despite the lack of decentralized exchanges (DEXes) on the blockchain, it has managed to ramp up more activity than leading smart contracts platform Ethereum. Users ... ...
