ETH could gain pace above the $1,350 and $1,400 resistance levels. Ethereum remained strong above the $1,265 support zone and started a decent increase. The price is now trading above $1,320 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. There is a major bullish trend line forming with support near $1,315 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $1,350 resistance zone. Ethereum Price Eyes More Gains Ethereum formed a base above the $1,260 level and started a decent increase, similar to bitcoin price. ETH was able to climb higher above the $1,280 and $1,300 levels. There was a break above the 50% Fib retracement level of the key drop from the $1,344 swing high to $1,262 low. Ether price is now trading above $1,320 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. It seems like the bulls are in control above the $1,320 level. It is also trading above the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the key drop from the $1,344 swing high to $1,262 low. Besides, there is a major bullish trend line forming with support near $1,315 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. An immediate resistance on the upside is near the $1,340 zone or the last swing high.
