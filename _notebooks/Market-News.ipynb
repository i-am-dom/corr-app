       "- Bank Of America’s Crypto Report: All You Need To Know.  Bank of America released their latest crypto report this week, as Bitcoin returns north of $50K. BofA strategists Alkesh Shah and Andrew Moss described the crypto market as &#8220;too large to ignore&#8221; and that &#8220;there could be more opportunity than skeptics expect.&#8221; Let&#8217;s take a bird&#8217;s eye view on key findings from the 140+ page report. Crypto, Institutionalized As BTC hangs tough above $50K, both BofA and our team&#8217;s internal perspective on Bitcoin inflows reflect strong institutional interest. Additionally, beyond simply traditional financial institutions, Bank of America also cites the potential for further integration of blockchain technology in daily life. &#8220;In the near future, you may use blockchain technology to unlock your phone; buy a stock, house or fraction of a Ferrari; receive a dividend; borrow, loan or save money; or even pay for gas or pizza,&#8221; the report states. Of course, many different projects are already working on tools for some of these exact use cases, and a whole lot more. Outside of existing economies ripe for reinvigoration, the report also calls out projects and firms that are becoming inherently native to the digital asset ecosystem. There has been ample growth across both of these categories, exemplified by the below chart showing mentions of digital asset language on earnings calls: If there is one thing that is abundantly clear, it&#8217;s that digital... ...

Cardano investors in Japan have come under scrutiny after authorities reported that investors in the asset had underreported their taxes from their trading activities. It was reported that multiple cities in the country had seen profits from trading in Cardano’s native token ADA but had not reported the earnings made from investing in the digital asset. Authorities are now beginning to strengthen taxation laws around cryptocurrencies given that citizens have taken to using digital assets as a way to evade tax liabilities. Japanese citizens are investing more in cryptocurrencies and avoid paying taxes on them due to their legality being yet to be determined.
