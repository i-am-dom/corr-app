       "- What Should We Expect From The Launch of The Bored Ape Yacht Club Tron?.  A new project has appeared on the raging NFT market and it is supposed to capture the attention of the Tron community. Bored Ape Yacht Club Tron is a copycat version of the Ethereum-based OG Bored Ape Yacht Club collection. Bored Ape Yacht Club Tron is the 3rd TRON-based project launched on the NFT-market. The first project of this kind was sold out in under 4 months, and the second – in just 36 hours. TRON NFTs have also demonstrated some spectacular results on the secondary market. For instance, Justin Sun bought a Tpunk for as much as $10.5 million. The Tron-based collection consists of 10,000 Bored Ape NFTs hosted on the TRON network. Each Bored Ape is unique and programmatically generated from over 170 possible traits, including expression, headwear, clothing, and more. Another 15 unique Apes were added to the collection specifically for the fans of the Tron network: FOR DIAMOND TOKEN HOLDERS (6/10000) &#8211; 6 NFTs dedicated to the projects included in the TRON ecosystem; FOR EPIC TRON FANS (6/10000) &#8211; 6 NFTs with unique traits created for TRON fans; SECRET GROUP (3/10000) &#8211; 3 secret NFTs that will come as a surprise for the whole community after minting. The minting price is 1,000 TRX for 1 NFT, which stands at the same level as previous TRON-based projects. By comparison, the average price of an Ethereum-based Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT is around 39 ETH, and for Tpunks the floor price is x20, and this floor ... ...

       "- Crypto Needs Regulation If It’s Going To Survive, Says SEC Boss.  The Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has called for the crypto space to work with regulators. The Financial Times reported that Chairman Gary Gensler had asked Congress to empower his agency so they will be better able to govern the market. It is still not clear yet which agency has oversight of the cryptocurrency industry, as regulators mainly classify bitcoin as more of a commodity than it is a security. Related Reading &#124; Deloitte Survey Shows 76% Of Finance Execs Think Physical Money Is Nearing Its End It is estimated that less than 10% of the world currently knows about crypto. But nevertheless, it is still a large enough number that has prompted regulators to start looking into ways of properly regulating these digital assets. It is no longer just retail investors who are trying to make some quick profit on highly volatile markets. Institutional investors have also thrown their hat in the ring, like in the case of Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy. Finance Is About Trust Gensler believes that if the market is to grow, then it needs to embrace regulation. The SEC chairman explained that regulation would provide trust in the market, which is important if the market does not want to become irrelevant over time. “Finance is about trust, ultimately,” Gensler said. Gensler’s focus is mostly on trading platforms, given that this is where the majority (~95%) of activities in the crypto market are carried... ...
