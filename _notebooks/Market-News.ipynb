       "- Here’s How Soon Ethereum Might Target $3600.  Ethereum has been zooming up on its charts over the past few days. In the last seven days, the altcoin posted double-digit gains as it secured a 20% increase in market value. Post the dip, Ethereum along with other major coins have followed similar kinds of price movement. At the time of writing, ETH was valued at $3230.12. Price action was considerably bullish today after weeks of consolidation as displayed by Ethereum. The altcoin toppled over its support level of $3085.60 and was seen hovering around the $3200 price level.

Ethereum Soars By 20% In The Last Week With Bitcoin recovering on its charts, the broader market displayed strength. Major altcoins have also witnessed increased buying strength. In the case of Ethereum, buyers have flocked the market and have also occasionally pushed ETH to an overvalued and overbought territory. Ethereum has breached resistance levels one after the other which has shot up investors&#8217; interest and confidence in the past week. Sustained buying strength could make ETH eye its immediate price ceiling of $3400. ETH has managed to surge 50% since January&#8217;s price dip.

       "- Bloomberg: Ethereum Price Levels May Fall Below $2,000.  After the cryptocurrency market collapsed in January, some assets closed the month in the red. This includes Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, which went below 27% from December. While Ethereum (ETH) has already seen positive returns in February, the potential of a price crash remains. The price of ETH might drop as low as $1,700, according to Bloomberg. Experts believe, however, that Ethereum&#8217;s bullish fundamentals will be preserved. Ethereum May Follow Last Year&#8217;s Price Trend Bloomberg has warned that it is pessimistic on Ethereum (ETH). Bloomberg experts anticipate that Ethereum might fall to as low as $1,700 in their latest Intelligence report. The drop, however, could be followed by an upward correction. According to Bloomberg, Ethereum (ETH) could follow in the footsteps of last year&#8217;s June to September price movement, and fall below current levels to reach the aforementioned price. The report reads: “Ethereum could repeat last summer and revisit about $1,700. Once the weaker leveraged long positions were purged, the resolution was a new high around $4,800 in November. Ethereum approaching the lower end of its range has greater risks for shorts than longs.” Led by senior commodity strategist Mike McGlone, the analysts noted that the ETH market is in a consolidation phase near the end of a bull market.
