TL;DR Breakdown Tron forms a bullish engulfing pattern after a downslide of over 14 percent yesterdayPrice could breakout as high as $0.18 in the upcoming trendSupport sits at the current price of $0.09 which is set to be maintained Tron price analysis shows that the coin is set to form a new trend starting today, that could potentially take price up to $0.18. The new upturn is formed after price fell more than 14 percent yesterday, to a month long low of $0.07. This downslide pushed trading volume, allowing buyers to consolidate in the market after support was breached at $0.09. This triggered the bullish response from the 28th ranked cryptocurrency, that now sits at a recovered price of $0.094 and continues to rise.  The current newfound bullish momentum is expected to face some backlash near the $0.12 mark. However attempts are expected to breakout towards $0.2. After yesterday&#8217;s decline, the price has now moved back above the 50 and 100-day moving averages, while also exhibiting a positive crossover in the intra-day trading session as per Tron price analysis. TRX followed a recovering larger cryptocurrency market, where Bitcoin and Altcoins showed recoveries from bloodbaths suffered earlier in the week. Bitcoin went above the $47,000 mark while Ethereum pulled past $3,500, each going up by 1.5 percent.
