Although in the past few days, the bears have tried to exert pressure as well which has been successfully overpowered by the bulls. The bullish momentum has been quite high today, as the Moving Average (MA) value is present way below the current price value i.e. at $0.099.

       "- Cardano Sees Over 40,000 Smart Contracts Deployed 4 Days After Alonzo HFC, How This Affects The Price.  Smart contracts have become a reality on the Cardano network after September 12th. After the Alonzo Hard Fork Combinator launch, developers could now go ahead and start creating smart contracts on the ecosystem. This would aid in developers creating decentralized applications (DApps) to provide decentralized finance (DeFi) services to the users of the blockchain. With the number of smart contracts that have been created on the network, it is no doubt that we are about to witness an influx of new decentralized apps on the network. The project has said that they are supporting developers in bringing their projects to life on the platform. By making the Cardano ecosystem as safe and developer-friendly as it possibly could. The developers, in turn, have shown their confidence in the network with the number of smart contracts already live on the ecosystem.

       "- Coinbase Is Set To Increase Corporate Bonds Amid Rising Demand.  In a recent development, Coinbase issued a junk bond, and the market seemed to be hungry for the instrument. Currently, the US crypto exchange is recording more demands for these bonds every day. With these demands, the crypto exchange&#8217;s sales have grown from $1.5B to $2B. Bonds are fixed investments that yield interest monthly. But when we talk of junk bonds, investors make higher returns but face higher risks as well. Companies usually issue junk bonds to raise capital very fast for a major project. Corporate Bond Orders Keep Rising The orders have continued to troop in for the Coinbase junk bond. One of our sources reveals that the orders amounting to $7 billion are competing for 7 and ten-year bonds, with interests of 3.375% &#38; 3.625% each. From our sources, we also learned that some claims have risen that the interest rates were lower than what Coinbase offered in the first quotes. Related Reading &#124; New To Bitcoin? Learn To Trade Crypto With The NewsBTC Trading Course This increasing demand proves that the exchange didn&#8217;t know the extent to which the public regarded its creditworthiness. If they offered higher rates in the quotes, it meant that Coinbase was unsure that many people would invest in the bonds. So, the high demand showed them their worth, and the company reduced the rates. Moreover, an analyst with Bloomberg stated that this high demand shows that debt investors have endorsed the exchange ... ...
